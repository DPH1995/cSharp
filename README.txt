Information about files in this repository:

'PkmnSimulator'
This is a C# application that uses Windows forms and the .NET framework. The application itself is a battle simulator for the game 'pokemon'
Currently, accounts can be registered and loaded from text files. Accounts have stored values which are manipulated throughout the application.
This is a personal project I am developing to further develop my C# skills.

-To run the application, it may be necessary to modify the filePaths in the classes to reflect the system that you are using as Im sure our directory's wont be named the same.



'WWTBAM'
The first C# application I developed. This application is similar to the popular TV gameshow. 
Users are asked a series of questions on their journey to win.
