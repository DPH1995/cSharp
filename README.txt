'SampleCode'
SampleCode is a code snippet program I am developing for myself to use in the workplace or anytime I find fitting. The program allows the
user to create entries where they can save a snippet of code. These snippets are saved and can be loaded from the application to view whenever
the user wants. V2 of this application will expand on the existing functionality and introduce directory management/sorting.

!-Update-! - V2 of SampleCode now uploaded. When creating a new sample, the user can enter the language of the file. This creates a directory if it
doesnt already exist. If it does exist, the file will be placed inside it's languages directory. The user can select between languages in the view entry
form and the application will load the saved files related to that language/directory. 



'PkmnSimulator'
This is a C# application that uses Windows forms and the .NET framework. The application itself is a battle simulator for the game 'pokemon'
Currently, accounts can be registered and loaded from text files. Accounts have stored values which are manipulated throughout the application.
This is a personal project I am developing for my brother to further develop my C# skills.

-To run the application, it may be necessary to modify the filePaths in the classes to reflect the system that you are using as Im sure our directory's wont be named the same.


'WWTBAM'
The first C# application I developed. This application is similar to the popular TV gameshow. 
Users are asked a series of questions on their journey to win.
